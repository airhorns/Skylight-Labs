		<h2>A Fresh Look at Building Web Applications</h2>
		<div style="width: 425px">
		<p>Web applications offer opportunities for entrepreneurs and businesses of all types. However, building them in house or with an ad hoc mix of consultants and self proclaimed IT experts often leads to an app built for functionality today and maintenance never. </p>
		<br/>
		<p>Our approach is refreshingly simple. We take care of everything needed to make an application an enduring success. Weâ€™ll build your application and manage it as long as you need it, providing detailed analytics, hosting, regular revisions and support- all backed by our no-BS guarantee and superior service. You pay an upfront development fee and a flat monthly service fee, skip the frustration and get back to focusing on building your business.  </p>
